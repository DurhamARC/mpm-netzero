# MPM for Net Zero

Project website for "Leveraging the Material Point Method for Large Deformation Soil-Structure Interaction to Realise Net Zero."

## About

This site provides information about a research project developing computational tools to address critical geotechnical challenges in the offshore renewable energy sector using the Material Point Method (MPM).

## Building the Site

The site is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
