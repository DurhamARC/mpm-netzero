# Partners and Team

## Project Leadership

### Durham University Engineering Department

The project is led by Durham University's Department of Engineering, which hosts one of eight strategic Research Nodes focused on **Computational Mechanics**. The department includes nine members of academic staff with broad, complementary experience in numerical methods applied to solving engineering problems.

Durham University has over 10 years of experience developing and applying the Material Point Method to geotechnical engineering challenges, supported by previous EPSRC-funded projects. This extensive research, validation, and benchmarking provides the foundation for transitioning the MPM into an industry-ready software tool.

#### Advanced Research Computing (ARC) Support

The project is supported by Durham University's Advanced Research Computing team, which provides:

- Professional-level software development practices
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) expertise
- Test-driven development methodologies
- Experience with large-scale open source software projects
- Software project management proficiency

The ARC team has successfully delivered software for various applied domains, including HEPData, ManyFEWS, and SCIMAP, bringing proven expertise to this project.

## Industry Partners

This is an **industry-initiated proposal** driven by stakeholders in the offshore renewable energy geotechnical community who face challenges that cannot be efficiently solved with currently available tools. Our partners represent all aspects of offshore wind, from consent and design to deployment and commissioning.

### Geotechnical Engineering Consultancies

Our consulting partners bring extensive experience in offshore geotechnical engineering, site characterization, foundation design, and installation analysis. They provide critical insights into:

- Real-world engineering challenges and workflows
- Industry-standard file formats and software integration requirements
- Validation case studies and benchmarking scenarios
- End-user needs for practical engineering applications

### Offshore Wind Developers

Developer partners provide the operational perspective of deploying offshore renewable energy infrastructure at scale. Their involvement ensures the software addresses:

- Practical deployment challenges
- Site-specific optimization needs
- Risk management requirements
- Integration with project delivery workflows

### Classification Societies

Classification society partners contribute expertise in:

- Standards and certification requirements
- Safety and reliability assessment
- Technical review and validation processes
- Industry best practices

### Software Development Partner

#### Oasys

Oasys has been included as a key software partner for their extensive experience in delivering cloud-based commercial software. Their involvement provides:

- Guidance on software architecture and deployment
- Commercial software development expertise
- Potential pathway for future commercialization beyond the project scope
- Understanding of software licensing and sustainability models

Oasys's participation helps ensure that the developed open source software can potentially transition to a commercially supported product if warranted by industry demand.

## Stakeholder Engagement

External partners have been involved from project inception and will remain at the center of the proposal's activities throughout its duration. This engagement includes:

### Stakeholder Workshops and Focus Groups

Partners participate in targeted workshops to provide feedback on:

- Integration of software within existing workflows and tools
- Industry-standard and convenient file formats
- Effective scripting and running of simulations
- Output formats and visualization of results
- Impact and adoption potential within stakeholder organizations

This is envisioned as a cyclical, iterative process to continuously optimize the software tools and ways of working.

### Training and Capacity Building

Towards the end of the project, two 2-day training workshops (one in-person, one online) will be provided free to members of the offshore renewable energy geotechnical community, ensuring broad dissemination and adoption of the developed tools.

## Collaborative Approach

This project represents a unique collaboration between world-leading academic research and industry practitioners facing real engineering challenges. By placing industry stakeholders at the heart of the software development process, the project ensures that the final product will:

- Meet genuine industry needs
- Integrate smoothly into existing workflows
- Be validated against real-world problems
- Have a clear pathway to adoption and impact

The collaborative approach avoids duplication of effort across multiple organizations and creates a shared resource that benefits the entire offshore renewable energy geotechnical community.

## Get Involved

The offshore renewable energy sector is rapidly evolving, and we welcome engagement from additional stakeholders interested in large deformation soil-structure interaction modeling. Whether you're an engineering consultant, developer, researcher, or equipment manufacturer, there may be opportunities to participate in:

- User testing and feedback
- Training workshops
- Case study development
- Software extension and development
